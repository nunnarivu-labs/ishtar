# Project Ishtar: An AI Chat Application

Project Ishtar is a personal project where I built an AI chat application using React and Google Gemini APIs. This project served as a hands-on opportunity to learn and implement various technologies, including:
- **Google Cloud Functions:** To run the Gemini models.
- **Firebase Authentication:** To manage user authentication.
- **Firebase Cloud Firestore:** To persist user prompts and AI responses.
- **Firebase Hosting:** To deploy the application as a website.
- **TanStack Query & Router:** For data fetching and client-side routing.
- **TanStack Virtual:** To efficiently virtualise messages, fetch the last 10 messages on initial load and load 10 more as the user scrolls up.
- **MUI:** To create a responsive user interface.
- **GitHub Actions:** For continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
- **Dark/Light Mode:** To provide a customizable user experience.
